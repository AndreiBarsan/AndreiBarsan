### Hi! üëã I'm Andrei and I work on computer vision for autonomous robots. ü§ñ

Check out my website [here](andreibarsan.github.io), or some of the projects that I've worked on below! ‚¨áÔ∏è
Recently, I've been working on [simultaneous localziation and mapping (SLAM) for multi-camera robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06562) and on exploring [how to jointly perform efficient multi-task learning for self-driving cars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06720)!

My [website](andreibarsan.github.io) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=nOj2GykAAAAJ) have more detailed lists of my current and past work!

Please don't hesitate to e-mail me if you'd like to get in touch! My address is on my website!
